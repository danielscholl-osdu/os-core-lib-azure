/**
 * Contains configuration methods for Azure dependencies.
 *
 * To use this package, you will need to provide any service specific
 * configuration that is required by the dependencies that you need to
 * instantiate. The specific configuration required by each dependency
 * can be found in
 * {@link org.opengroup.osdu.azure.dependencies.AzureConfig}.
 *
 * After doing this, you can then inject the dependency using
 * <pre>@Inject</pre> or <pre>@Autowire</pre>. For example, here
 * is how you would configure KeyVault:
 *
 *
 * Provide a configuration value:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   @Bean
 *   @Named("KEY_VAULT_URL")
 *   public String keyVaultURL() {
 *       return "...";
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Inject dependency:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   @Inject
 *   private SecretClient secretClient;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Don't forget to wire up the configuration in your application
 * entry point:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   public static void main(String[] args) {
 *       Class<?>[] sources = new Class<?>[]{
 *           ...,
 *           AzureConfig.class
 *       };
 *       SpringApplication.run(sources, args);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
